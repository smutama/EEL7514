Dear GitHub user

You have forked a repository of a student who published his solutions to the exercises from the course EEL7514 (Machine Learning) at UFSC.

However, posting solutions is not allowed according to the course rules and our institution's code of conduct, so I asked the original student to make his repository private. However, your fork is still public. Could you please also make your repository private?

Thank you.
